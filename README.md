detection, selection, tracking



**
This project was created for educational purposes to explore the topic of computer vision. It uses YOLOv8 and ultralytics. The task performed by the application is to detect objects in the video stream, and you can use the cursor to select up to three objects to track. Binding to the tracking object is not implemented.

To run the project, you need to add your own video stream and your own model.

The project is under development.
