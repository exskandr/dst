detection, selection, tracking



**
This project is created for educational purposes to explore the topic of computer vision. It utilizes YOLOv8 and ultralytics. The program's task is to detect objects in a video stream, and with the cursor, up to three objects can be selected for tracking.

Functionality for binding the tracked object to a specific position has been added. Adding objects occurs not in a list, but in a dictionary, which will allow for storing additional necessary data in the future.

The new update changes the data storage to a database so that online data access is always available. It also adds functionality that reads data from the database and provides it for processing by another video stream.

To run the project, you need to add your own video stream and your own model.

The project is under development.
